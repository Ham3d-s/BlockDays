# This _redirects file is intended for hosting platforms like Netlify or Vercel
# that support this syntax for SPA (Single Page Application) routing.
# It tells the server to serve index.html for any path that doesn't match a file.
#
# Note: GitHub Pages does NOT use this file. For SPA routing on GitHub Pages,
# a custom 404.html page with a redirect script is typically required.
